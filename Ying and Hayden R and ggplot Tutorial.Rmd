## Preface

In <font size="4" color="red">2020</font>, a pandemic of the virus called <font size="4" color="blue">COVID-19</font> hit human society harshly, with <font size="4" color="dark blue">millions of</font> people infected and <font size="4" color="dark blue">thousands of</font> people died. As simple country <font size="4" color="orange">biologists</font>, we stay at home at the behest of Government of Canada, blessing *Homo sapiens* for <font size="5" color="green">health</font> and congratulating <font size="5" color="green">nature</font> for a temporary break from human acitivties. 

<font size="5">**Don't give up!**</font>   says a rock. We continue <font size="4" color="brown">academia</font> and brain-hearting <font size="4" color="brown">science</font> work in Lougheed Lab at Queen's University. We decide today is the day, to do <font size="4" color="blue">R</font> work. Follow **Hayden** and **Ying** and do today's **brain exercise**. We will go through:  


- Section 1: R basics
- Section 2: Data simulation 
- Section 3: Power analysis 
- Section 4: Data visulization 

A real <font size="4" color="orange">biological question</font> to be solved: 

- Does frog mortality rate change in current COVID-19 situation in Ontario?

Two <font size="4" color="orange">hypotheses</font> raised: 

- H0: It does not change.
- H1: Frog mortality rate decreases with decreasing traffic under Ontario lockdown. 

<font size="4" color="DarkPink">Ready? Go!</font>

#### Section 1: R Basics (5-10min tops) (Hayden):
1. how to make a project
2. markdown vs script
3. github links
4. handling error messages 
        (dependancies missing, unexpect ",", googling answers)
5. how to google 101
6. other helpful links (Ying)
    + Quick-R: https://www.statmethods.net/index.html 
    + ggplot2: https://learnr.wordpress.com 
7. packages
    + You need to install: pwr, ggplot2, dplyr, knitr, kableExtra


#### Section 2: Data simulation (30min) (Hayden):
1. how to generate a "fake" data set

  -(Frog mortality, frog species (3), location (3), sampling year (2010-2020), Total number of cars)
  -generate date for each year separately, then can change number of cars for this year specifically, 
  -combine the data from different years into one data frame
  -start with 1 species and 1 location, add more in if you can later
  
```{r}
Frog_MortInt <- rnorm(n=90, mean = 26, sd = 1)# assuming average frog mortality of 25% 

COVIDFrog_Mort <- rnorm(n = 9, mean = 24, sd = 1)
Frog_Mort_Total <- c((rnorm(n=90, mean = 26, sd = 1)), (rnorm(n = 9, mean = 24, sd = 1)))# assuming average frog mortality of 26% initially and then 24% after covid hit
Frog_Mort_Total
Species <- c("Anaxyrus fowleri", "Pseudacris crucifer", "Rana pipiens")
Location <- c("Opinicon Road", "Opinicon Road", "Opinicon Road", "Hwy15", "Hwy15", "Hyw15", "Jones Falls", "Jones Falls", "Jones Falls")
Year <- seq(2010, 2020, by=1)
Cars_Op <- rnorm(n=33, mean = 50, sd = 1)
Cars_H15 <- rnorm(n=33, mean = 60, sd = 1)
Cars_Falls <- rnorm(n=33, mean = 40, sd =1)
for (i in Year) {
  sample(Location, 3, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL)   
  
}

NewYear <- rep(Year, each = 9)
NewSpecies <- rep(Species, 11)
NewLocation <- rep(Location, 9)

#Now we can make our data frame!

Data <- cbind(NewYear, NewLocation, NewSpecies, Frog_Mort_Total)

```

  
2. how to export the data set

3. power analysis????? (can go if need be)




#### What is power analysis? (Ying)

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# How to make a nice table? Please check: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html 

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

PAcol1 <- c("", "Null hypothesis H0 is true", "Alternative hypothesis H1 is ture")
PAcol2 <- c("Fail to reject H0", "Correct, what we want", "Type II error")
PAcol3 <- c("Reject H0", "Type I error", "Correct, Power")
PAtable <- data.frame(PAcol1, PAcol2, PAcol3)
colnames(PAtable) <- NULL

kable(PAtable) %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

**Statistical power** is the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis.

**Power** = Pr (Reject H0 | H1 is true) = 1 - Type II error rate

It mostly depends on:

* **Alpha level** - significance level = Type I error rate. Larger alpha, greater power.
    + Pr (observed | H0 is ture) < alpha, reject null 
    + Pr (observed | H0 is ture) > alpha, fail to reject null 

* **Effect size** - magnitude of the difference between groups. Larger effects, larger power. 

* **Sample size** - Larger sample size, smaller sampling error, greater statistical power. 

**A power analysis** can be used to estimate the minimum sample size required for an experiment, given a desired significance level, effect size, and statistical power.


#### How to do power analysis? (Ying)
```{r}
library(pwr)
# t-test
pwr.t.test(d = 0.2, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8, type = c("one.sample"))
# n is the sample size, d is the effect size, sig.level is alpha
# Cohen suggests that d values of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 represent small, medium, and large effect sizes respectively.
# type indicates a two-sample t-test, one-sample t-test or paired t-test.

# ANOVA
pwr.anova.test(k=5,f=.25,sig.level=.05,power=.8)
# 

# correlation
pwr.r.test(r = 0.2, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8)
# n is the sample size and r is the correlation



```




#### Estimation Stats? (Ying)
There have been a lot of discussions in terms of not using p-value. 

Check this website: https://www.estimationstats.com/?fbclid=IwAR0d6nqcf3IbNgSb772R3TnzL4Nv7AtQFmLNToBvISmQmEMFyyVF6FdJ-lc#/background. 

Some example papers: 

  * Sullivan and Feinn. 2002. Using Effect Size—or Why the P Value Is Not Enough.


- Test width of confidence interval for effect size

library(dplyr)

set.seed(54321)

N = 10
N = 40
N = 100
c1 <- rnorm(N, mean = 100, sd = 25)
c2 <- rnorm(N, mean = 100, sd = 50)
g1 <- rnorm(N, mean = 120, sd = 25)
g2 <- rnorm(N, mean = 80, sd = 50)
g3 <- rnorm(N, mean = 100, sd = 12)
g4 <- rnorm(N, mean = 100, sd = 50)
gender <- c(rep('Male', N/2), rep('Female', N/2))
dummy <- rep("Dummy", N)
id <- 1: N

wide.data <- 
  tibble::tibble(
    Control1 = c1, Control2 = c2,
    Group1 = g1, Group2 = g2, Group3 = g3, Group4 = g4,
    Dummy = dummy,
    Gender = gender, ID = id)


my.data   <- 
  wide.data %>%
  tidyr::gather(key = Group, value = Measurement, -ID, -Gender, -Dummy)


library(dabestr)

two.group.unpaired <- 
  my.data %>%
  dabest(Group, Measurement, 
         # The idx below passes "Control" as the control group, 
         # and "Group1" as the test group. The mean difference
         # will be computed as mean(Group1) - mean(Control1).
         idx = c("Control1", "Group1"), 
         paired = FALSE)

two.group.unpaired 

plot(two.group.unpaired, color.column = Gender)

```
