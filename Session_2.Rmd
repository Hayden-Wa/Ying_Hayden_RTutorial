## Preface

Welcome back my friends! 

As another rock says <font size="5">**Smile!**</font>. 

We are glad you have lived through our first 3 sections (if not, [here is the material](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/YingChen94/BnR_Hayden_Ying_R_Session/blob/master/R_Hayden_Ying_20200429.html))! 

- Section 1: R basics
- Section 2: Data simulation
- Section 3: Power analysis

We will continue with the following section 4 and 5 today! 

- Section 4: Estimation statistics
- Section 5: Data visulization 

<font size="4" color="blue">R</font>eady?

Problems of p-value and statistically significance:

- Dichotomy is not informative of the observed data (e.g. size of the difference between the groups), and can be misleading.  
- 


Alternatives:

- Bayesian analysis 
- 



Important concepts:

- Standard deviation: an descriptive index. 
- Standard error: an estimative index.
