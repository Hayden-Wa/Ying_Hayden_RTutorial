## Preface

In <font size="4" color="red">2020</font>, a pandemic of the virus called <font size="4" color="blue">COVID-19</font> hit human society harshly, with <font size="4" color="dark blue">millions of</font> people infected and <font size="4" color="dark blue">thousands of</font> people died. As simple country <font size="4" color="orange">biologists</font>, we stay at home at the behest of Government of Canada, blessing *Homo sapiens* for <font size="5" color="green">health</font> and congratulating <font size="5" color="green">nature</font> for a temporary break from human acitivties. 

<font size="5">**Don't give up!**</font>   says a rock. We continue <font size="4" color="brown">academia</font> and brain-hearting <font size="4" color="brown">science</font> work in Lougheed Lab at Queen's University. We decide today is the day, to do <font size="4" color="blue">R</font> work. Follow **Hayden** and **Ying** and do today's **brain exercise**. We will go through:  


- Section 1: R basics
- Section 2: Data simulation 
- Section 3: Power analysis 
- Section 4: Data visulization 

A real <font size="4" color="orange">biological question</font> to be solved: 

- Does frog mortality rate change in current COVID-19 situation in Ontario?

Two <font size="4" color="orange">hypotheses</font> raised: 

- H0: It does not change.
- H1: Frog mortality rate decreases with decreasing traffic under Ontario lockdown. 

<font size="4" color="blue">R</font>eady? Go!

#### Section 2: Data simulation (30min) (Hayden):
1. how to generate a "fake" data set

  -(Frog mortality, frog species (3), location (3), sampling year (2010-2020), Total number of cars)
  -generate date for each year separately, then can change number of cars for this year specifically, 
  -combine the data from different years into one data frame
  -start with 1 species and 1 location, add more in if you can later
  
```{r}
# Frog Mortality 
Frog_Mort <- rnorm(n=99, mean = 0.25, sd=0.2) # sd=1 will give you many negative values and values over 1
length(Frog_Mort[which(Frog_Mort<0)]) # If there are negative values, we could change them to positive
length(Frog_Mort[which(Frog_Mort>1)]) # If there are values over 1, need to delete them 
Frog_Mort[which(Frog_Mort<0)] <- abs(Frog_Mort[which(Frog_Mort<0)])
Frog_Mort <- sort(Frog_Mort) # smaller values at the beginning

Cars <- rnorm(n=99, mean = 50, sd = 1) # sd is a bit too small? 
Cars <- sort(Cars)

# Assign cars to frog mortality in a dataset 
dat <- data.frame(Frog_Mort, Cars) # small cars have small frog mortality 

# add locations to it 
dat$Location <- rep("Opinicon Road",99)
dat$Year <- rep("2001",99)

# then we create another 2 datasets with another 2 locations and year 2001 (the mean and sd for cars and frog mortality can be changed), we can merge them together. Year 2001 will be complete.
# then we repeat it to create another 10 years. And merge them all together. 
# We can probably write a loop to do this. 

Species <- c("Anaxyrus fowleri", "Pseudacris crucifer", "Rana pipiens")
Location <- c("Opinicon Road", "Hyw15", "Jones Falls")
Year <- seq(2010, 2020, by=1)
Cars_Op <- rnorm(n=33, mean = 50, sd = 1)
Cars_H15 <- rnorm(n=33, mean = 60, sd = 1)
Cars_Falls <- rnorm(n=33, mean = 40, sd =1)

Frog_MortInt <- rnorm(n=90, mean = 26, sd = 1)# assuming average frog mortality of 25% 

COVIDFrog_Mort <- rnorm(n = 9, mean = 24, sd = 1)
Frog_Mort_Total <- c((rnorm(n=90, mean = 26, sd = 1)), (rnorm(n = 9, mean = 24, sd = 1)))# assuming average frog mortality of 26% initially and then 24% after covid hit

Location <- c("Opinicon Road", "Opinicon Road", "Opinicon Road", "Hwy15", "Hwy15", "Hyw15", "Jones Falls", "Jones Falls", "Jones Falls")
Year <- seq(2010, 2020, by=1)
Cars_Op <- rnorm(n=33, mean = 50, sd = 1)
Cars_H15 <- rnorm(n=33, mean = 60, sd = 1)
Cars_Falls <- rnorm(n=33, mean = 40, sd =1)
for (i in Year) {
  sample(Location, 3, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL)   
  
}

NewYear <- rep(Year, each = 9)
NewSpecies <- rep(Species, 11)
NewLocation <- rep(Location, 9)

#Now we can make our data frame!

Data <- cbind(NewYear, NewLocation, NewSpecies, Frog_Mort_Total)


```

  
2. how to export the data set

3. power analysis????? (can go if need be)


<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### Section 3. Power analysis (30-40min) (Ying)
##### 3.1 What is power analysis? (5 min)

```{r, include=FALSE,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# How to make a nice table? Please check: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html 

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

PAcol1 <- c("", "Null hypothesis H0 is true", "Alternative hypothesis H1 is ture")
PAcol2 <- c("Fail to reject H0", "Correct", "Type II error")
PAcol3 <- c("Reject H0", "Type I error", "Correct. Power")
PAtable <- data.frame(PAcol1, PAcol2, PAcol3)
colnames(PAtable) <- NULL

kable(PAtable, caption="Table 1. Relationship between statistical power and hypotheses.") %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

**Statistical power** is the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis.

- **Power** = Pr (Reject H0 | H1 is true) = 1 - Type II error rate

It mostly depends on:

- **Alpha level** = significance level = Type I error rate. Larger alpha, greater power.
    + Pr (observed | H0 is ture) < alpha, reject null 
    + Pr (observed | H0 is ture) > alpha, fail to reject null 

- **Effect size** - magnitude of the difference between groups. Larger effects, larger power. Notice that there are many definitions of the effect size. We will stick with the simplest one, which is the difference of two group means divided by the pooled standard deviation. 

- **Sample size** - Larger sample size, smaller sampling error, larger statistical power. 

- **Your purpose** - For example, one might want to see if the regression coefficient is different from zero, while the other wants to get a very precise estimate of the regression coefficient with a very small confidence interval around it. This second purpose requires a larger sample size than does merely seeing if the regression coefficient is different from zero. 

**A power analysis** 

- Can be used to estimate the minimum sample size required for an experiment, given a desired significance level, effect size, and statistical power (more recommendations fall between 0.8 and 0.9). For example, how many locations (sample size) do we need to detect the frog mortality decrease of 10% (effect size) from 2019 to 2020 with a statistical power of 80% and a significance level of 0.05?

- Can be used to determine power, given an effect size and sample size. For example, we have 20 locations (sample size) from each of 2019 and 2020. What is the statistical power to detect a 10% decrease (effect size) of frog mortality rate with a significance level of 0.05?


**Limitations of power analysis:** 

- If you change the methodology used to collect the data or change the statistical procedure, you will mostly likely have to re-do power analysis. 
- A standard power analysis gives you a “best case scenario” estimate of the necessary number of subjects needed to detect the effect. In most cases, this “best case scenario” is based on assumptions and educated guesses.  If any of these assumptions or guesses are incorrect, you may have less power than you need to detect the effect. 
- You usually get a range of numbers you need, rather than a precise number. For example, if you do not know what the standard deviation of your outcome measure will be, you guess at this value, run the power analysis and get X number of subjects. 
- The number of statistical tests that you intend to conduct will influence your necessary sample size:  the more tests that you want to run, the more subjects that you will need. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

##### 3.2 How to do power analysis? (10 min)

1. Specify your null hypothesis. 
2. Decide your statistical analysis. 
2. Decide your alpha, effect size, power. 
3. 


```{r}
library(pwr)
# t-test
pwr.t.test(d = 0.2, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8, type = c("one.sample"))
# n is the sample size, d is the effect size, sig.level is alpha
# Cohen suggests that d values of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 represent small, medium, and large effect sizes respectively.
# type indicates a two-sample t-test, one-sample t-test or paired t-test.

# ANOVA
pwr.anova.test(k=5,f=.25,sig.level=.05,power=.8)
# 

# correlation
pwr.r.test(r = 0.2, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8)
# n is the sample size and r is the correlation



```

##### 3.3 Alternative to power analysis - Estimation Stats (Ying)
There have been a lot of discussions in terms of not using p-value.
